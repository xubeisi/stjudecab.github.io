### Overview
 I am a highly motivated, detail-oriented computational biologist, I enjoy challenging problems and like to develop new and effective approaches  to deal with them. I have experience in working  with different next generation sequencing data ranging from transcriptome (RNA-Seq), epigenome (ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, CUT&RUN, WGBS, RRBS), chromatin structure (Hi-C, ChIA-PET) and single-cell sequencing data. He has also developed several computational methods and visualization tools such as:  
   - **R3CPET**: A method to predict the proteins that can contributed to chromatin interactions.
   - **FIND**: A method to detect differential chromatin interactions in Hi-C data.
   - **HiC-Viewer**: A web-based tool to  visualize and predict the 3D structure of chromatin.
   - **PFC-explorer**: A web-interface to visualize the prefrontal cortex single-cell RNA-Seq data.
