### Overview
Zhongshan thinks himself as a computational biologist, although he is a bioinformatics research scientist in St Jude Children’s Hospital. He likes to read biologically related papers and plays with publicly available human genetics and cancer genomics data. If he can understand these data very well and has some new ideas after evaluating these open data, he would like to write some codes to make the integrative analyses easier. He is a big fun for SAS statistical language and MATLAB language, although most people now like R and Python. Of course, he needs to use R or Python scripts, and sometimes, he prefers to writing codes in Perl, an older language compared to the hot Python language. He also likes fishing and climbing mountains. So now you know Zhongshan a little better!

Human Genetic and Cancer Genomic Data zhongshan knows how to analyze:

- Genome-wide association study (GWAS)
- Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS)
- Common association analysis
- Statistical analysis
- Pathway enrichment analysis
- Non-coding driver mutation screening
- Somatic mutation calling
- CNV imputation


### Education
- PhD, The Unviersity of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, P.R.CHINA (2015)
- Post-doc, Queen's University, Canada (2016)
- Post-doc, Yale University, US (2017)
